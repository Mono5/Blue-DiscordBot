# Blue-DiscordBot

This is a full rebrand of the Red-DiscordBot (created by TwentySix), with a few features removed and added.
Working to create the perfect Discord bot, so 6 bots won't be needed anymore (talking about one of the servers I'm on).

For installation, download and install Python 3.5< from https://www.python.org/downloads (don't forget to add it to PATH), then run the launcher. In the Maintenance menu you'll find "Install Requirements". After you've got everything needed, you're clear to run it.
First launch requires setting up the bot. For now, only a bot token is needed, or if you want to run this as a self-bot (do it at your own risk), when it asks for a token enter your e-mail, and you'll be asked for a password.
