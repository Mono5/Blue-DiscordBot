# Blue-DiscordBot

This is a full rebrand of the Red-DiscordBot (created by TwentySix), with a few features removed and added.
Working to create the perfect Discord bot, so 6 bots won't be needed anymore (talking about one of the servers I'm on).

For installation, download and install Python 3.5< from https://www.python.org/downloads (don't forget to add it to PATH), then run the launcher. In the Maintenance menu you'll find "Install Requirements". After you've got everything needed, you're clear to run it.
First launch requires setting up the bot. For now, only a bot token is needed, or if you want to run this as a self-bot (do it at your own risk), when it asks for a token enter your e-mail, and you'll be asked for a password.

As the Discord rules say,
A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, respond to other user's messages. This means it should not respond to commands, should not autoreply to certain keywords, etc. You must be the only one that can control it.
A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, do "invite scraping". This is the action of detecting server invites in chat, and automatically joining a server using that invite.
As selfbots run under your account they are subject to the same Terms of Service. Meaning they should not spam, insult or demean others, post NSFW material, spread viruses or illegal material, etc. They have to follow the same rules that you follow.

If I find out there are more rules than those then I'll add them here.
